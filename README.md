## Multi-Label Text Classification & Preprocessing

This project focuses on preprocessing text data and applying multi-label classification techniques using machine learning models. The notebook includes data handling, database integration, feature extraction, and classification approaches for text datasets.

# üöÄ Features

Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and preparing text using regex.

Tokenization and vectorization (CountVectorizer).

Generating WordClouds for visualization.

Database Integration

Functions to connect, create tables, and check for existence.

Multi-Label Classification

# Models:

Logistic Regression

Gaussian Naive Bayes
